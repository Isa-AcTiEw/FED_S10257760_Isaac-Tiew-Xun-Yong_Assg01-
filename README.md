# Assignment 1 FED Web development project

My website is based on an existing company called AYN that specialises in maufacturing affordable gaming handhelds. This website will provide ample information on the gaming handhelds design, 
technical specifications and compatible games. Thus, allowing consumer's to make more decisive decisions when choosing to purchase a gaiming handheld from the company.
 
## Design Process
 
I designed the website to specifically cater to consumer's of all age groups who are intrested in AYN's gaming handeheld and are looking to purchase one for themselves in the future.
Based on my targeted stakeholder i thought about the list of interractions as well as features that would be useful for them when visting my website.

- As a consumer, I would want to be able to understand more about the prodcut before decideing on whether to purchase it, thus a product infrormation page on the website
is crucial for them. This page highlights the design,features and technical specifications of the gaming handheld which would be useful to a consumer when deciding between our
handhelds and other types of gaming handheld in the same categroy that are out in the consumer market.

- As a consumer, I would want to be able to have quality assurance when dealing with these gaming handhelds. Thus, a partners overview displays to the consumer's the list of reputable and respectable brands that the company partners with and collaborates with when acquiring thr parts for the product

- As a consumer, I would also want to be able to browse the various products that are avilable for purchase and be able to save it for later. Thus, a store landing
page would be able to help the consumer shop and purchase these products

- As a consumer, I would want to be able to view this website conveniently on any platform that i choose to use. Thus, the website has to be reponsive.

- As a consumer i would want to be able to navigate arround the website easily and seamelessly. Thus, navigation tabs and menus have been implmented throughout
the website
