# Assignment 1 FED Web development project

My website is based on an existing company called AYN that specialises in maufacturing affordable gaming handhelds. This website will provide ample information on the gaming handhelds design, 
technical specifications and compatible games. Thus, allowing consumer's to make more decisive decisions when choosing to purchase a gaiming handheld from the company.
 
## Design Process
 
I designed the website to specifically cater to consumer's of all age groups who are intrested in AYN's gaming handeheld and are looking to purchase one for themselves in the future.
Based on my targeted stakeholder i thought about the list of interractions as well as features that would be useful for them when visting my website.

- As a consumer, I would want to be able to understand more about the prodcut before decideing on whether to purchase it, thus a product infrormation page on the website
is crucial for them. This page highlights the design,features and technical specifications of the gaming handheld which would be useful to a consumer when deciding between our
handhelds and other types of gaming handheld in the same categroy that are out in the consumer market.

- As a consumer, I would want to be able to have quality assurance when dealing with these gaming handhelds. Thus, a partners overview displays to the consumer's the list of reputable and respectable brands that the company partners with and collaborates with when acquiring thr parts for the product

- As a consumer, I would also want to be able to browse the various products that are avilable for purchase and be able to save it for later. Thus, a store landing
page would be able to help the consumer shop and purchase these products

- As a consumer, I would want to be able to view this website conveniently on any platform that i choose to use. Thus, the website has to be reponsive.

- As a consumer i would want to be able to navigate arround the website easily and seamelessly. Thus, navigation tabs and menus have been implmented throughout
the website



This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url. 

## Features

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
